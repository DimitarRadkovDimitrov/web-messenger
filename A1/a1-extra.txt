-The program should accept a .cc file from the command line and it should write the results to a output file. If the input file was named infile.cc you would run the program using:\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 a1 infile.cc\
The output file should have the same file name but end with .c. So in the above example the output file should be named infile.c.\
\
-Your program should pass comments through to the output file.\
-You should store the whitespace (space, tab, newline, carriage return) which follows each token so that when you write the token you can then write the formatting information. The formatting of the file should not change dramatically after your program has modified the file.\
-You don't need to work with literals as parameters to functions. So fn(3) will not occur. It will always be a variable such as fn(number) where the type of number is defined elsewhere in the program.\
-Variables declaration will appear before methods in a class.\
-You cannot use any regular expression tools or libraries for this assignment.\
